# GregTech Modpack Guidebook

Welcome to the GregTech Modpack! This guide will walk you through the early, middle, and late stages of GregTech, with all the machinery, automation, and power systems you'll need to become an industrial powerhouse.

---

## Early Game: Setting Up

### 1. **Gather Resources**
Start by gathering **Copper**, **Tin**, and **Iron**. These will be your primary resources in the early game.

### 2. **Craft Basic Machines**
Your first machines will be the **Macerator** (for ore doubling) and **Electric Furnace** (for faster smelting).

---

## Mid-Game: Automation

### 1. **Set Up Ore Processing Chains**
Create advanced ore processing systems using **Macerators**, **Smelters**, and **Centrifuges** to maximize resource output.

### 2. **Upgrade Your Power**
Switch from **Steam Boilers** to **Nuclear Reactors** for more efficient energy generation.

---

## Late Game: Power and Crafting

### 1. **Fusion Reactors**
Generate vast amounts of power with **Fusion Reactors**.

### 2. **Endgame Machinery**
Craft **Quantum Armor**, **Laser Drills**, and more to reach the pinnacle of GregTech.


# Troubleshooting

### 1. **My Machines Aren't Running**
- Make sure your machines have a steady power supply. If they’re running low on energy, check your **EU Network** or **Steam Supply**.
- Ensure that your machines are correctly connected to power sources like **Cables** or **Pipes**.

### 2. **I Can’t Craft Higher Tier Machines**
- Check that you have the proper materials and processing steps for higher-tier machines. Some machines require **alloy recipes** and **multi-step crafting** that need to be done in sequence.
